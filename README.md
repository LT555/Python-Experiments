# Python Experiments

I made this repository for the initial code I created in DSCI 8133 *Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State University.

## Plan

The plan for this repository includes adding a data file in the future and using Jupyter notebook for interacting with it. 

## About Me

I am a student and employee of Mississippi State University and I have a keen interest in data science and machine learning. I love to explore new technologies and improve my skills.

- I enjoy coding in Python. In particular, it's application to **Remote Sensing** technologies.
- I have experience with data visualization.
- I am currently learning about deep learning.
